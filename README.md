## Workout Tracker

https://a4-keiraschoolcraft.vercel.app/

This is a workout tracker specifically built to track rowing workouts. This was basically redone from scratch because the previous configuration of my app was not condusive to porting to Next.js. Differently than before, the workout history table is populated via the database.
**important**: there is only one user because I was having a very difficult time. Username: admin, Password: password.

Sometimes the app gets stuck at the root '/'. Just add the '/login' to get where you need.
